# Kernel-SVM-classifier-for-binary-classification

1, Training and Prediction
Implement SVM based training and prediction. 
Three kernels: ker=linear, polynomial and gaussian. 
Two parameters, C and kpar. 
Different datasets have been provided.

2, Evaluation Metrics
Evaluate by comparing different kernels, different parameter settings. 
The point is to see both the accuracy and the efficiency.
1)	Accuracy: number of correctly classified test data over the whole dataset. (Function is already implemented for you.)
2)	Measure time for training, and prediction respectively (on different datasets).

3, Cross-validation
Implement the cross-validation function for the tuning of parameters.


In report, write down the math formula. 
Explain implementation details in the report: the usage of each function, especially the ones you added.
Report accuracy and average running time (for an optimally selected C+kpar) for all given binary-labeled datasets and for all three kernels.
